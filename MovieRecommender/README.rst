MovieRecommender
================

Movie recommendation application for CDAP_.

Overview
--------
The MovieRecommender application recommends movies to users using collaborative filtering.

* The ``ratings`` and ``movies`` data is taken from the `MovieLens Dataset <http://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/>`_
* The recommendation engine is based on the ALS (Alternating Least Square) implementation in Apache Spark MLlib library.

Implementation Details
----------------------

The MovieRecommender application is composed of the components:

* ``Streams`` for ingesting ``ratings`` data into the system
* A ``Service`` to store ``movies`` in a ``Dataset``
* A ``Service`` that recommends movies for a particular user
* A ``Spark`` Program which builds a recommendation model using the ALS algorithm and recommends
  movies for all the users

|(App)|


The ``RecommendationBuilder`` Spark program contains the core logic for building the movie
recommendations. It uses the ALS (Alternating Least Squares) algorithm from Apache Spark's MLlib
to train the prediction model.

|(RecommendationBuilder)| 

First, ``RecommendationBuilder`` reads the ``ratingsStream`` and uses it to train the prediction
model.  Then, it computes an RDD of not-rated movies using the ``movies`` dataset and the
``ratings`` dataset. It uses the prediction model to predict a score for each not-rated movie and
stores the top 20 highest scored movies for each user in the ``recommendations`` dataset.


Installation & Usage
====================
*Pre-Requisite*: Download and install CDAP_.

From the project root, build ``MovieRecommender`` with `Apache Maven <http://maven.apache.org/>`_ ::

  MAVEN_OPTS="-Xmx512m" mvn clean package
  
Deploy the Application to a CDAP instance defined by its host (defaults to localhost)::

  bin/app-manager.sh --host [host] --action deploy
  
Start the Application Flows and Services::

  bin/app-manager.sh --host [host] --action start
  
Make sure that the Flows and Services are running (note that the
``RecommendationBuilder`` Spark program will be started later)::

  bin/app-manager.sh --host [host] --action status
  
Ingest ``ratings`` and ``movies`` data::

  bin/ingest-data.sh --host [host]

Run the ``RecommendationBuilder`` Spark Program::

  bin/app-manager.sh --host [host] --action run

The Spark program may take a couple of minutes to complete. You can check if it is complete by its
status (once done, it becomes STOPPED)::

  bin/app-manager.sh --host [host] --action status
  
Once the Spark program is complete, you can query for recommendations via an HTTP request using the ``curl`` command::

  curl -v \
  -X GET 'http://localhost:10000/v2/apps/MovieRecommender/services/MovieRecommenderService/methods/recommend/1'

On Windows, a copy of ``curl`` is located in the ``libexec`` directory of the example::

  libexec\curl -v \
  -X GET 'http://localhost:10000/v2/apps/MovieRecommender/services/MovieRecommenderService/methods/recommend/1'
  
This will return a JSON response of rated and recommended movies::

  {"rated":["ratedMovie1","ratedMovie2"],"recommended":["recommendedMovie1","recommendedMovie2"]}

To stop the application, execute::

  bin/app-manager.sh --host [host] --action stop
